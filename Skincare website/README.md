# Skincare Clinic Website

Welcome to the Skincare Clinic Website! This website provides information about various skincare treatments, product recommendations, and allows users to schedule consultations with skincare professionals. The website is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js for running the development server.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to the clinic, services, and testimonials.
- **Treatment Services**: Detailed descriptions of available skincare treatments.
- **Product Recommendations**: A catalog of recommended skincare products.
- **Online Appointment Booking**: Users can book an appointment with a dermatologist or skincare consultant.
- **Contact Form**: Allow users to contact the clinic for inquiries or consultations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: Structure of the pages.
  - **CSS**: Styling the website for modern, responsive design.
  - **JavaScript**: For interactive features like form validation and dynamic content.
- **Backend** (Running Server):
  - **Node.js**: Used for running the development server using Express.js (if required) or any other purpose.
- **Deployment**:
  - The website can be deployed to platforms like **Heroku**, **Netlify**, or **Vercel** for frontend and **Heroku** or **AWS** for the backend (if extended in the future).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for running the server)
- **npm** (Node package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aruldemila/skincare-clinic-website.git
````

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd skincare-clinic-website
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** (for Node.js, if you plan to run a local server):

   * Run the following command to install any necessary backend dependencies (even if Node.js is just for serving):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   * You can run the Node.js server (this will typically serve static files or APIs if extended in the future):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   * This will start the server and serve the website on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Access the Website**:

   * Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.
